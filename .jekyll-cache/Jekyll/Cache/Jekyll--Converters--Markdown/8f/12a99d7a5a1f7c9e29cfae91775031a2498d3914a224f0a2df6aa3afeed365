<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Social media plays a pivotal role in the widespread sharing of information on the Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Social media platforms have been used across several countries by public administration as part of the communication plan in order to disseminate accurate information on COVID-19 and raising awareness in preventative behaviours.</p>

<p>However, social media platforms have also been used to spread misinformation and disinformation
about COVID-19 (i.e. infodemic), which reduces the effective response of governments to the
emergency of COVID-19 pandemic. This issue has raised concerns among many health organizations:
the World Health Organization (WHO), has recognized that managing the COVID-19 infodemic is a
critical part of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 information diffusion in Mexico presents an interesting case study of polarized debate
and infodemic on social media. On the one hand, the Mexican Government has deployed a COVID19 information campaign through daily conferences and social media. On the other hand, social media platforms exhibit infodemic and polarized opinions about the official health security
measures.</p>

<p>This study aims to analyse the COVID-19 information diffusion in Mexico through a massive data
analysis on Twitter and Reddit. First, Twitter and Reddit data related to COVID-19 in Mexico were
retrieved through their respective API (Application Programming Interface) and using natural
language processing. Then, an analysis of networks of hashtags and users over time and space was
performed to characterize the information diffusion on the users networks. Finally, the information
diffusion was fit in the epidemic model Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR). As result, we have
obtained different characterizations of the SIR model in Twitter and Reddit. We also found that
polarized opinions about the same topic have also different patterns in the same social platform.</p>
